# Password Manager Dotfiles Manager

This is designed to be a super-barebones dotfile manager that stores all of your dotfiles as secure notes in your password manager of choice.
Simple -- lots of other good options out there
Secure -- you already trust your password manager to store secure values and to synchronize them between computers
Private -- honestly, even with encryption or templating, I don't really want my dotfiles in a public git repo, and putting them in a private repo adds another layer of authentication to the setup process
Multi-machine -- again, your password manager provides this for you already

## Installing

Copy that curl + tar command from github-dev-init

Optional: ln -s whatever to an appropriate location on your PATH

## Configuring



## Dependencies

Only whatever password manager you choose and `bash` on a unix-like system are required to use this.

(also curl + tar if you want to use the one-line install)

// TODO: test it on a bunch of platforms and list those here
